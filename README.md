#RGGAssistedLiving

Clips project for the course of Artificial Intelligence.
The aim of this project is to develop the reasoning behind a robotic agent using CLIPS, the widely used rule-based programming language.

Please read the project report "relazioneCLIPS.pdf" in order to have a better understanding of all strategies adopted.

This work is based on the already existing GUI CLIPSMONITOR. For CLIPSMONITOR installation details follow the link: https://github.com/diegorullo/ClipsMonitor.
